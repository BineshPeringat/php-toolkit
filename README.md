# PHP Toolkit

A set of generic tools for PHP projects by Binesh Babu Peringat.

The idea is to simplify the setup and creation of projects without dependence of  frameworks. Each tool is a light-weight, stand-alone application that focuses on doing one task right.

> There is no license with this toolkit. It is open and free (free as in free beer).
